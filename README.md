# The Great Adventure

How 2D Games Work ?

Existence of time (process time, pressing button) : 
  - in this type of game, program keeps running until game close or stop button
  - character is a series of static pictures that keeps being updated really quickly so it looks like it's moving
  - FPS 60: update the screen 60 times per second but it's 60 static images
